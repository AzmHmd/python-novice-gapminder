Leslie Lamport once said, "Writing is nature's way of showing you how sloppy your thinking is."
The same is true of programming:
many things that seem obvious when we're thinking about them
turn out to be anything but when we have to explain them precisely.

## Python supports a large community within and outwith research.

*   The [Python 3 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) covers the core language
    and the standard library.

*   [PyCon](https://pycon.org/) is the largest annual conference for the Python community.

### Python Distributions

*   [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org) - Anaconda, the "kitchen sink" distribution of Python.

*   [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) - Minimal version of the conda installer which can install Python libraries. 

*   [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) is the home of the Jupyter Notebook.

*   [osgeo4w](http://osgeo4w.org) open source geographic software for Windows. Includes a python distribution for geographical applications.

### Useful Libraries

*   [SciPy](https://scipy.org) is a rich collection of scientific utilities.
    It is also the name of [a series of annual conferences](https://conference.scipy.org/).

*   [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org) is a library for numerical operations such as matrix manipulation.

*   [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) is the home of the Pandas data library.

*   [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) is home to the matplotlib library.

*   [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org) is home to the Scikit-learn machine learning library.

*   [biopython](http://biopython.org) is home to the biopython library which has lots of useful bioinformatics and biology related functions.

*   [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/index.html) is home to the geospatial data abstraction library which includes a python version. 

*   [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org) is home to the Symbolic Maths library.

*   [openCV](https://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html) is home to the OpenCV computer vision library.


### Extra Help

*   Stack Overflow's [general Python section](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python)
    can be helpful,
    as can the sections on [NumPy](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/numpy),
    [SciPy](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scipy),
    [Pandas](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas),
    and other topics.
